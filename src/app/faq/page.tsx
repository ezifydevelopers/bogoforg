	General: [
		{ question: "Why go custom instead of off-the-shelf?", answer: "You get exactly what you need: flexibility, scalability, security, and ownership without license lock-in. Custom solutions are tailored to your specific workflows and can evolve with your business." },
		{ question: "How soon can we start?", answer: "Typically within 1–2 weeks after a short discovery call. We'll align on scope, timeline, and approach, then kick off the project quickly." },
		{ question: "Can you integrate with our team?", answer: "Yes — we can work embedded with your squad or as an autonomous pod with weekly demos. We adapt our workflow to match your team structure and preferences." },
	],
	Development: [
		{ question: "What technologies do you work with?", answer: "We primarily work with modern stacks like Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, and cloud platforms. We choose technologies based on your needs, but prefer proven, maintainable tools." },
		{ question: "How do you reduce timeline and cost?", answer: "Senior teams, strong defaults, automation (CI/CD, codegen), and ruthless scope clarity. We use proven tools and patterns to build faster without sacrificing quality." },
		{ question: "Do you provide ongoing support?", answer: "Yes, we offer ongoing support and maintenance packages. This includes bug fixes, updates, monitoring, and feature enhancements as your product evolves." },
	],
	Pricing: [
		{ question: "Do you work fixed-price?", answer: "For well-defined scopes, yes. Otherwise we prefer sprint-based pricing with clear milestones and deliverables. This gives you flexibility while maintaining predictability." },
		{ question: "What's included in your pricing?", answer: "Our pricing includes project planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and initial support. Additional services like ongoing maintenance are quoted separately." },
		{ question: "Do you offer payment plans?", answer: "Yes, we offer flexible payment plans. Typically we structure payments around milestones to align with project progress and your cash flow." },
	],
	Support: [
		{ question: "What does success look like?", answer: "Agreed outcomes (KPIs), predictable delivery, and post-launch support with iteration. We define success metrics upfront and track them throughout the project." },
		{ question: "How do you handle project changes?", answer: "We use an agile approach with weekly demos and feedback loops. Changes are evaluated for impact on timeline and budget, then incorporated into the next sprint." },
		{ question: "What happens after launch?", answer: "We provide post-launch support including bug fixes, monitoring, and optimizations. Many clients continue with us for ongoing feature development and maintenance." },
